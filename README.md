Mod of BONES Rockbox theme
https://themes.rockbox.org/index.php?themeid=3579&target=ipod6g

Theme changes:
- Created a mini status bar with "pause/play status", small battery % and hold status, this shows at the top of the screen
- Changed HOLD staus indicator from "XXX" to "HOLD"
- Swapped the sync skull - I couldnâ€™t find a nice 8 bit usb logo so changed it to an upload arrow

UI changes
- Changed the Database layout so modded that to be more like the iPod Songs layout. See here for original mod https://www.reddit.com/r/rockbox/comments/1g1ikkx/sharing_my_simplified_database_layout_config/

How to install - place files inside .rockbox
- Make sure to use the "Daily Build" so you have access to better options such as Shuffle
- For theme changes: upload "Themes", "Fonts" and "WPS" contents
- For Database changes upload "tagnavi_user.config"

To streamline the Main Menu
- Use go to Pulgins -> Applications -> main_menu_config -> and toggle the items you do not want, dont forget to "Save and Exit" before quitting
